### Description
The user will be able to battle the selected Pokemon based off the current location of the user. The Pokemon powers and attacks will be influenced by the weather that is occuring in the users current area.
- Ex: if it is raining in Charlotte,NC, a Squirtle would be a great choice!

The battle continues without the users input, however the user will be able to see the health status of both Pokemon to stay interactive with the battle.
